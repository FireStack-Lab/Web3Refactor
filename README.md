# Intro

`Web3.js` is an important part of ethereum ecosystem, almost all node.js-based and browser-based apps or services use it.

Tooling for example `Truffle`, and wallet like `MetaMask`, they all start with `Web3.js`.

`Infura.io`, particularly, implemented a lot of features inside `Web3.js`, also including access method to `IPFS`'s storage.

`Web3.js` is more like a multi-eco-system common tools for developers from all sides.

We started porting and migrating `Web3.js` for other pub-chain since mid-2018, and we find that even the developer tools for each pub-chain are different, however the basic parts are somehow similar.

We think it is important to understand these when developing multi-language-sdks
